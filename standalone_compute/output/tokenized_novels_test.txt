[ HOUSEOFHEINEBROTHERSINMUNICH ] THE house of Heine Brothers , in Munich , was of good repute at the time of which I am about to tell , —a time not long ago ; and is so still , I trust . It was of good repute in its own way , seeing that no man doubted the word or solvency of Heine Brothers ; but they did not possess , as bankers , what would in England be considered a large or profitable business . The operations of English bankers are bewildering in their magnitude . Legions of clerks are employed . The senior book-keepers , though only salaried servants , are themselves great men ; while the real partners are inscrutable , mysterious , opulent beyond measure , and altogether unknown to their customers . Take any firm at random , —Brown , Jones , and Cox , let us say , —the probability is that Jones has been dead these fifty years , that Brown is a Cabinet Minister , and that Cox is master of a pack of hounds in Leicestershire . But it was by no means so with the house of Heine Brothers , of Munich . There they were , the two elderly men , daily to be seen at their dingy office in the Schrannen Platz ; and if any business was to be transacted requiring the interchange of more than a word or two , it was the younger brother with whom the customer was , as a matter of course , brought into contact . There were three clerks in the establishment ; an old man , namely , who sat with the elder brother and had no personal dealings with the public ; a young Englishman , of whom we shall anon hear more ; and a boy who ran messages , put the wood on to the stoves , and swept out the bank . Truly he house of Heine Brothers was of no great importance ; but nevertheless it was of good repute . The office , I have said , was in the Schrannen Platz , or old Market-place . Munich , as every one knows , is chiefly to be noted as a new town , —so new that many of the streets and most of the palaces look as though they had been sent home last night from the builders , and had only just been taken out of their bandboxes It is angular , methodical , unfinished , and palatial . But there is an old town ; and , though the old town be not of surpassing interest , it is as dingy , crooked , intricate , and dark as other old towns in Germany . Here , in the old Market-place , up one long broad staircase , were situated the two rooms in which was held the bank of Heine Brothers . Of the elder member of the firm we shall have something to say before this story be completed . He was an old bachelor , and was possessed of a bachelor ’ s dwelling somewhere out in the suburbs of the city . The junior brother was a married man , with a wife some twenty years younger than himself , with two daughters , the elder of whom was now one-and-twenty , and one son . His name was Ernest Heine , whereas the senior brother was known as Uncle Hatto . Ernest Heine and his wife inhabited a portion of one of those new palatial residences at the further end of the Ludwigs Strasse ; but not because they thus lived must it be considered that they were palatial people . By no means let it be so thought , as such an idea would altogether militate against whatever truth of character painting there may be in this tale . They were not palatial people , but the very reverse , living in homely guise , pursuing homely duties , and satisfied with homely pleasures . Up two pairs of stairs , however , in that street of palaces , they lived , having there a commodious suite of large rooms , furnished , after the manner of the Germans , somewhat gaudily as regarded their best salon , and with somewhat meagre comfort as regarded their other rooms . But , whether in respect of that which was meagre , or whether in respect of that which was gaudy , they were as well off as their neighbours ; and this , as I take it , is the point of excellence which is desirable . Ernest Heine was at this time over sixty ; his wife was past forty ; and his eldest daughter , as I have said , was twenty-one years of age . His second child , also a girl , was six years younger ; and their third child , a boy , had not been born till another similar interval had elapsed . He was named Hatto after his uncle , and the two girls had been christened Isa and Agnes . Such , in number and mode of life , was the family of the Heines . Such a one was Isa Heine at the time of which I am writing . We English , in our passion for daily excitement , might call her phlegmatic , but we should call her so unjustly . Life to her was a serious matter , of which the daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts . She was her mother ’ s companion , the instructress of both her brother and her sister , and the charm of her father ’ s vacant hours . With such calls upon her time , and so many realities around her , her imagination did not teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home . When love and marriage should come to her , as come they probably might , she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties . In the meantime she was contented to keep her mother ’ s accounts , and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the Ludwigs Strasse . But change would certainly come , we may prophesy ; for Isa Heine was a beautiful girl , tall and graceful , comely to the eye , and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a man ’ s home . I have said that an English clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy banking-office in the Schrannen Platz , and I must say a word or two of Herbert Onslow . In his early career he had not been fortunate . His father , with means sufficiently moderate , and with a family more than sufficiently large , had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle , and then to one of the universities , at which he had run into debt , and had therefore left without a degree . When this occurred , a family council of war had been held among the Onslows , and it was decided that Herbert should be sent off to the banking-house of Heines , at Munich , there being a cousinship between the families , and some existing connections of business . It was , therefore , so settled ; and Herbert , willing enough to see the world , —as he considered he should do by going to Munich , —started for his German home , with injunctions , very tender from his mother , and very solemn from his aggrieved father . But there was nothing bad at the heart about young Onslow , and if the solemn father had well considered it , he might perhaps have felt that those debts at Cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son . When Herbert arrived at Munich , his cousins , the Heines , —far-away cousins though they were , —behaved kindly to him . They established him at first in lodgings , where he was boarded with many others , having heard somewhat of his early youth . But when Madame Heine , at the end of twelve months , perceived that he was punctual at the bank , and that his allowances , which , though moderate in England , were handsome in Munich , carried him on without debt , she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself , that he should live with them . In this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the Ludwigs Strasse . But all this happened long ago . Isa Heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to Munich , and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman . And when , as she ripened into womanhood , this young man came more closely among them , it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others . Her uncle and father , she knew , had approved of Herbert at the bank ; and Herbert had shown that he could be steady ; therefore he was to be taken into their family , paying his annual subsidy , instead of being left with strangers at the boarding-house . All this was very simple to her . She assisted in mending his linen , as she did her father ’ s ; she visited his room daily , as she visited all the others ; she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangement , —but by no means such notice as she did of her father ’ s ; and without any flutter , inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world , she made him one of the family . So things went on for a year , —nay , so things went on for two years with her , after Herbert Onslow had come to the Ludwigs Strasse . But the matter had been regarded in a very different light by Herbert himself . When the proposition had been made to him , his first idea had been that so close a connection with , a girl so very pretty would be delightful . He had blushed as he had given in his adhesion ; but Madame Heine , when she saw the blush , had attributed it to anything but the true cause . When Isa had asked him as to his wants and wishes , he had blushed again , but she had been as ignorant as her mother . The father had merely stipulated that , as the young Englishman paid for his board , he should have the full value of his money , so that Isa and Agnes gave up their pretty front room , going into one that was inferior , and Hatto was put to sleep in the little closet that had been papa ’ s own peculiar property . But nobody complained of this , for it was understood that the money was of service . For the first year Herbert found that nothing especial happened . He always fancied that he was in love with Isa , and wrote some poetry about her . But the poetry was in English , and Isa could not read it , even had he dared to show it to her . During the second year he went home to England for three months , and by confessing a passion to one of his sisters , really brought himself to feel one . He returned to Munich resolved to tell Isa that the possibility of his remaining there depended upon her acceptance of his heart ; but for months he did not find
