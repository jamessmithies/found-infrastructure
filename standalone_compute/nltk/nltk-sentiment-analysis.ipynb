    "# This code will read the tokens from tokenized_complete.txt, perform sentiment analysis on each token, and write the results to sentiment_results.txt. Each line in sentiment_results.txt will be a dictionary representing the sentiment scores of a token.Please note that this is a very basic example. The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is more effective when used on larger pieces of text (like sentences or paragraphs) rather than individual tokens. Also, this code assumes that your tokens are separated by spaces. If your tokens are separated by something else, youâ€™ll need to modify the split() function accordingly. \n",
